# A small Challenge for age prediction based on face image

The purpose of our project was to organize a challenge which uses features extracted from images with human faces, 
in order to classify the personâ€™s age group in the picture as adult or minor. The WIKI database was used, as well as 
the CNN provided along with it, in order to ex- tract the features. Participants of our challenge are pro- vided with train
and validation datasets and they are re- quired to find the best approach in order to classify an image in one of the two 
categories. The adult/minor clas- sification has important applications in various domains. In this report, we describe in
more details the set up of the challenge and present some approaches for tackling the problem.
