# A small Challenge for age prediction based on face image

The purpose of our project was to organize a challenge which uses features extracted from images with human faces, 
in order to classify the person’s age group in the picture as adult or minor. The WIKI database was used, as well as 
the CNN provided along with it, in order to ex- tract the features. Participants of our challenge are pro- vided with train
and validation datasets and they are re- quired to find the best approach in order to classify an image in one of the two 
categories. The adult/minor clas- sification has important applications in various domains. In this report, we describe in
more details the set up of the challenge and present some approaches for tackling the problem.

# Usage

To preprocess the data:

Download the data set (cf input/README.md)

from this folder run

$ python src/data_preprocessing.py

the output file is : output/example.py
